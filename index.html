          <p>
            In December 2018, I had an amazing job at a company I loved, doing work I was immensely proud of. This made
            my
            decision to quit extraordinarily difficult. This decision could itself be the topic of a long and rambling
            blog post, but that’s a story for another day. In this post, I’ll talk through my experience being
            unemployed,
            my approach to the job search, and how I ultimately made the decision for my next career move.
          </p>

          <h3>Unemployment</h3>
          <p>
            I left my prior job without a new one lined up. When my friends heard I was entering a phase of
            funemployment,
            they all assumed I would be taking off to backpack around the world for 6 months. I take that to mean that I
            do a
            pretty good job of hiding my true workaholic anxious nature. By the time the New Year rolled around, I was
            already
            irrationally worrying about my employability and felt like I was behind schedule with everything — interview
            prep,
            networking, and everything in-between. Soliciting advice from a few friends who had taken extended time off,
            I was
            able to assuage the rising feeling of panic and settle into a loose routine for my time off. I would get a
            full
            night’s sleep every day, spend mornings catching up on the latest tech news and analysis (I read a LOT of
            Stratechery), and take at least one weekday each week to do absolutely nothing job related (this usually
            meant
            riding my bike all day). The rest of the time would be split between catching up with old friends and former
            colleagues, gathering information about companies I was interested in, and practicing my programming and
            technical
            whiteboarding skills.

          <h1>Paris-Brest-Paris 2019 Ride Report</h1>
          <p>
            Paris-Brest-Paris has a credible claim to being the greatest
            cycling event in the world. If this is true, it’s not because the
            route is the most beautiful or the most challenging (though it has
            its fair share of both), but because of the sheer number of people
            participating. Over 6,000 riders attempt the 1200 km course, and
            the drama, triumph, and despair of each individual ride is on full
            display to onlookers.
          </p>
          <p>
            No ride report can accurately recreate the experience of the ride,
            so rather than a play-by-play account, I’ll instead tell a series
            of vignettes about my sensory experiences — the sights, sounds,
            smells, tastes, and aches of my 88 hours on the bike. It’s a
            terribly incomplete picture, but telling the full story is an
            impossible task. Paris-Brest-Paris is something you have to ride
            to truly understand.

          <h1>Lights</h1>
          <p>
            Riding PBP means riding at all times of day, including the dead of
            night. My wave rolled at 7:30pm, with the sun hanging inches above
            the horizon. The chaos and the rush of the start made it tough to
            appreciate the sunset, but night fell around us and my jitters
            calmed. We began to catch riders in prior start waves, and the
            infinite trail of red tail lights ahead looked like
            <span style="color: red">glowing coals</span>
            marking the way to Brest. Every now and then I’d be tempted to
            look back, but it was always a mistake. Modern headlights are
            <em>viciously bright</em>. Even a brief glance would make my eyes
            wince in pain and leave spots in my vision. I had to glean
            whatever information about the situation behind me by watching the
            shadows dance. When the lines of my shadow sharpened, it meant
            someone was approaching from behind. As they
            <span style="filter: blur(0.66px)">faded</span>, it meant we were
            separating.
          </p>
          <p>
            Three hours into the ride, I stopped on the side of the road to
            relieve myself. As I stretched my back and neck, I looked up at
            the sky and for the first time noticed the half-moon and the stars
            of the Milky Way above. I took a few extra seconds to soak in the
            beauty of the moment — red lights marching on ahead, white lights
            slowly approaching from behind, and the cosmos above, twinkling
            softly like any other night. I remounted my bike and rejoined the
            endless stream of red and white making its way west.

          <h1>Smells</h1>
          <p>
            At our first stop in the town of Mortagne-au-Perche, my first
            remark was “this whole town smells like brie.” Our evening start
            meant that for the first part of the ride, the French countryside
            was completely cloaked in darkness. Without visual stimulation
            aside from the lights of the other riders, my primary sensory
            experience was that of smell.
          </p>

          <p>
            Rain from the previous day had moistened the ground, and every
            forest, farm, and town that we sped through was an explosion of
            odors. Four primary smells left a major impression on me, and all
            but one I think was best described by a different type of cheese:
            brie, feta, and chèvre. The fourth was manure with some sour
            notes. Though none were unpleasant by any means, 770 miles of
            riding incurred fatigue in every part of my body, nose included.
            The occasional whiff of wild lavender was always a welcome
            reprieve, and early morning towns with boulangeries baking fresh
            croissants and baguettes were absolutely divine.
          </p>

          <p>
            Many US brevets travel on roads with moderate to heavy auto
            traffic, so I’m mostly accustomed to the smells of gasoline and
            diesel exhaust while I ride. I will take the smells of livestock,
            wildflowers, and pastries any day.

          <h1>Scenery</h1>
          <p>
            The PBP course rolls up and down through the tiny villages of
            Normandy and Brittany. The scenery, while at times quite lovely,
            can also become tiresome. The following pattern repeats endlessly:
            ride through a flat stretch lined with either cow pastures or corn
            fields. Turn into a small climb through a deciduous forest, and
            descend until you reach the outskirts of town. The road pitches up
            again, and cobblestone houses begin to appear, getting denser and
            denser until you reach the top of the hill, invariably marked by a
            large church. Begin the descent through the center of town over
            cobbled roads, past the boulangerie and the pharmacy, and before
            you know it, you’re back in the corn fields. Quédillac, Médréac,
            Merléac, Rétéac, Loudéac. Rinse and repeat.

            holding up great. Finally catch up to Irving, Ian and Ben who started 30 minutes before me. Grateful for the
            chance to sit up and ride with them and stave off any potential muscle soreness from hammering with this
            group.

            stop, stretch out my legs, and attempt to manage the pain by easing back on the pace and trying different
            pedaling positions. Eventually start riding much slower, and with more emphasis on the right leg.

            generate soreness on my right side. Start limping at controls and having trouble walking down stairs.

          <p class="hidden entry">
            <b>Tuesday 9 PM:</b> Right knee decently swollen and left knee still feeling moderate
            pain. Riding slowly has
            taken a huge toll on me. Without the rush of physical exertion, staying focused on the road takes an
            enormous amount of mental energy, leading to boredom and frustration. I swear up and down that I am never
            doing this, ever again. To stay awake and alert I fall back on caffeinated gels, which make me nervous and
            jittery. In a bout of frustration, just as we are hitting Loudéac for the second time, I turn up the gas.
            For a solid 15 minutes, I’m flying. Lots of pent up energy from the gels and caffeine. Passing dozens of
            riders like they are standing still, and momentarily the joy of riding returns. I stop briefly at a town
            corner and notice that even though I am not feeling tired or breathing heavily, my heart is absolutely
            racing. I stop, take thirty deep breaths, and try to down-regulate both my heart rate and my exhilaration.
            Oddly enough, both knees felt fine. Take a mental note of that, but fully expect this foolishness to put
            my
            knees further into a hole.

            crusty baguettes. Legs feel moderately better, but can tell that knees still won’t be happy back on the
            bike. 450 km to go. How will I manage?

            fast. I can’t resist the temptation, and jump on the train and start hammering to keep up with them.

            decent
            sized train of riders in my slipstream. Get swept up by a group of twelve or so serious 84-hour riders and
            tuck in. This is some of the most fun I’ve ever had on a bike.

            hard means I’m paying less attention to my hands, and at this control I start to notice some of my fingers
            going numb, a classic symptom of ulner nerve compression. I’ll take that any day over knee pain.

            <b>Wednesday 11 AM:</b> the finish. Nothing is terribly painful, but nothing feels
            great either. Contact points
            (butt, hands, feet), joints (knees, ankles), supporting tissues and small muscles (neck, Achilles) are all
            straining from nearly 90 hours of continuous effort. We are elated to have finished successfully, and all
            ignore the aches and pains in the glow of the finish.

            <b>Thursday 8 AM:</b> the aftermath. The worst after-effects are chapped lips and
            sores/abrasions in my mouth and
            tongue, which make it hard to eat. Of course legs and butt are sore. Not about to jump on the bike again
            today, but after 1200 km of riding, I’m pleasantly surprised at how good I feel. I can sense the
            randonnesia
            setting in, and thoughts begin to form in my head — what might a 2023 ride look like?
