The PBP course rolls up and down through the tiny villages of Normandy and Brittany. The scenery, while at times quite lovely, can also become tiresome. The following pattern repeats endlessly: ride through a flat stretch lined with either cow pastures or corn fields. Turn into a small climb through a deciduous forest, and descend until you reach the outskirts of town. The road pitches up again, and cobblestone houses begin to appear, getting denser and denser until you reach the top of the hill, invariably marked by a large church. Begin the descent through the center of town over cobbled roads, past the boulangerie and the pharmacy, and before you know it, you’re back in the corn fields. Quédillac, Médréac, Merléac, Rétéac, Loudéac. Rinse and repeat.
