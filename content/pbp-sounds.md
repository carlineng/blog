What does it sound like when 6000+ riders from every country on earth attempt to ride 1200 km?

* The steady whirring of my bike’s drivetrain.
* The creaks, squeaks, and rattles of the bikes owned by 6000 people who all have wildly varying bike maintenance standards.
* The low rumble of an approaching peloton moving twice my speed, anticipating the rush of wind as they blow past.
* Heavy labored breathing as we grind up the endless rolling hills on our way to Brest
* The sound of Ian’s voice up ahead as he chatters happily away with one of our many friends on the ride.
* Cheers of “Bon route!” and “Bon courage!” from spectating French villagers.
* Crinkling of space blankets as riders toss and turn, trying to steal a few precious minutes of sleep on the floor of a control point.
* Constant chirping from Garmins, Wahoos, or other bike computers, alerting their owners to who knows what.
* The clopping of bike cleats on asphalt and tile floors.
* A cacophony of every language on Earth. French, German, English, Italian, Hindi, Korean, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish, Chinese and more.
